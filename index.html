            an EMT
            for
            many years before I joined the
            bootcamp. I’ve been
            looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          <h2 class="card__highlight">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
          <blockquote class="card__description">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
            needed some
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
            staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could
            ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
            It
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
